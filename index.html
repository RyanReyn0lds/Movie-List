        <h1>The Best Movies According to Cooper Thomas</h1>
        <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2><hr>
        <h3>#1 Iron Man 1</h3>
        <p>I chose this movie because iron man is the goat, it shows how he started with nothing in a cave which was just an idea to perfecting his idea and also without him the entire marvel universe would be doomed, and he absolutely carried in Endgame.</p>
        <h3>#2 Deadpool</h3>
        <p>I chose Deadpool beacause its a hilarious movie, and I feel Ryan Reynolds played it perfectly.</p>
        <h3>#3 Click</h3>
        <p>Once again its a hilarious movie, Adam Sandler in general is just a hilarious guy and i feel this movie is what got me into comedy</p>
